# InfoTrack SEO Test

## Overview

Hello and thank you for taking the time to review my submission. I have opted to submit this using a combination of .NET Core and Angular 7 and wrapped everything within one solution alongside a project with some unit tests.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core]
- [Angular 7]
- [NodeJS] (version 10.x or greater)

## Web Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `InfoTrackSEOCore.Angular` folder in a command prompt.
2. Type `npm install` to install all the Angular dependencies.

## Micro Service Setup

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Press F5 or otherwise run the `InfoTrackSEOCore` project with the built-in debugger.


## Usage
* The Angular website runs by default on port 4200 (i.e. http://localhost:4200)
* The .NET Service runs by default on port 5000 (i.e. http://localhost:5000)
* If both these are set as above, the application should work fine.
